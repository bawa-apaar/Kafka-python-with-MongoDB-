Apache Kafka with MongoDB

Overview:
When there are many Source Systems and many target systems and they all have to exchange data with one another, things become complicated. That is why Apache Kafka comes in. 
Apache Kafka is a distributed publish-subscribe messaging system and a robust queue that can handle a high volume of data and enables you to pass messages from one end-point to another.
MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents, which makes the database very flexible and scalable.
